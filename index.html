                <p>In order to collect the data necessary for thorough analysis, two complementary methods were used,
                    which most effectively reflect public opinion regarding the question of creating a platform for the
                    purchase and sale of furniture: semi-structured interviews taken with residents of several
                    dormitories of Leipzig (Lumis, Basecamp, The Hood, SmartWings), and questionnaires of the residents
                    of Lumis themselves, who provided different views on the question, based on their own experience of
                    purchasing or selling things in different dormitories and the problems that arose as a result of
                    this. These methods made it possible to deepen the given study with diverse, flexible data from
                    various sources and to identify non-trivial behavioral patterns and motivations.</p>
                <p>The interview protocol was designed with the goal of systematic collection of data from 8-10
                    residents of various dormitories with the deliberate selection of 2-3 examples from each identified
                    category of persons: urgent need to purchase a product, exploratory viewing of purchase-sale offers,
                    extremely limited means for purchasing a product, occasional sellers. This selection was made with
                    the goal of covering the widest possible range of user experience and motivation.</p>
                <p>Each interview lasts 15-20 minutes and takes place in a question-answer format from general topics to
                    specific ones. In the beginning, taking about 2 minutes, the goals of the research are explained,
                    its confidentiality is explained, and permission is asked for recording the conversation for further
                    transcript and analysis. In the course of the conversation, the interview could deviate from the
                    structure or from the initially set tasks; fragments of the recording in which this happens were not
                    used in the transcript and review. The transcription of the conversation was carried out with the
                    help of a program created by the author of this research, written in the programming language Python
                    with built-in libraries, which ensures accurate translation from oral form to written without loss
                    of information and words of the speaker.</p>

                        browsers, students with limited means, and occasional sellers, ensuring wide coverage of

                        Lumis residents buy and sell items, particularly through the WhatsApp group. Your responses are
                        confidential and will help design a better solution. May I record this for analysis purposes?

                        transaction (or giving up)? [Answer]. Have you ever missed a good deal because you couldn't find
                        the listing again? Tell me about it. [Answer]. How do you feel when you see buying or selling

                        are from Lumis residents only versus the broader Leipzig area? [Answer]. Would you pay a small
                        fee (for example, 1 euro) to list an item if it meant better visibility? Why or why not?
                        [Answer]. What information do you need to see in a listing before contacting a seller? [Answer].
                        How do you prefer to communicate with buyers or sellers? (WhatsApp, in-app chat, email?)
                        [Answer]. What concerns do you have about buying used items from fellow residents? [Answer]."

                        <p>He labeled existing student trading platforms as slow and unreliable, noting a three-day wait
                            for a microwave response and listings written without critical details. Price comparison is
                            essential for him, and he argued that sorting and filtering tools are necessary to stay
                            within budget.</p>

                Method 2 Online Questionnaire
            </h2>
            <p class="section-description">Seven Lumis residents supplied structured responses on tenure, budget,
                success rates, and expectations for a dedicated exchange platform.</p>

                    <h3>Respondent Profile</h3>
                    <p>Four of the seven respondents have lived in Lumis for at least half a year, indicating meaningful
                        exposure to existing WhatsApp marketplaces. Most rent their rooms long term, and five of seven
                        spend no more than 200 euros monthly on non-essential items.</p>
                    <p>Only around 40 percent of their attempted exchanges in WhatsApp groups succeed, and the overall
                        satisfaction score averages three out of five, revealing a split between mildly positive and
                        clearly frustrated experiences.</p>

                    <h3>Current Pain Points</h3>
                    <p>Respondents highlighted missing structure and unreliable follow through: buyers cannot locate
                        items quickly, sellers often fail to reply, and discount opportunities disappear in chat history
                        without action. Communication breakdowns and organizational chaos were the most frequent
                        complaints.</p>

                <div class="survey-card">
                    <h3>Platform Expectations</h3>
                    <p>Students overwhelmingly desire a dedicated platform offering speed, safety, and structure. They
                        prefer convenient search, a well-organized interface, and secure payments within the
                        application. While most want the service to remain free, a small fee to cover maintenance is
                        acceptable, and few require it to be limited to a single dormitory.</p>

                    <h3>Adoption Signals</h3>
                    <p>Every participant endorsed developing a standalone application or website and expressed
                        willingness to help test it. The majority want a solution that can scale across Leipzig
                        residences, mixing social network familiarity with reliable marketplace workflows.</p>

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <div class="conclusion-card">
                <p>As a conclusion of the conducted survey among dormitory residents, both Lumis and others located in
                    Leipzig, it can be noted that WhatsApp groups are not a safe and convenient tool for the purchase
                    and sale of personal items, since they do not provide a centralized and understandable platform with
                    a clear structure.</p>
                <p>Every survey participant supported the idea of creating a separate application or website where
                    exchange could be carried out safely, and also expressed willingness to participate in its
                    development or testing within their available time. Despite the fact that monetization of the
                    platform is not welcomed by the majority, the possibility of charging a small fee to cover technical
                    maintenance expenses is allowed.</p>
                <p>Students want to see a simple, structured, convenient, and safe application combining elements of a
                    social network and an online store, which would provide efficient exchange of goods and multi-level
                    communication between users.</p>
